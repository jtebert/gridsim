# Gridsim

*Simple grid-based robot simulator*

**[Documentation](https://gridsim.readthedocs.io/)**

I'm planning on using this as a simple test-bed for my algorithms.

This package will be a package/library for the simulator itself, not the robot code. This follows a similar structure (with a World, Robot, Logger, and Viewer) as Kilosim.

I plan to package this with PyPi so I can easily use it with separate repositories for the algorithms.

For reference on package structure, see the [package-boilerplate](https://github.com/jtebert/package-boilerplate).
