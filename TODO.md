# TODO

## Fix

- include in readme.rst doesn't work on github

## Code

- Add sensing + something to sense
  - Also, do Robots get to know world dimensions so they can avoid hitting the edge?
- Write tests
- Add checks for robots that are initialized outside the world. (Perhaps make it check positions on the first tick step?)
- Add a way to seed random number generator for repeatable trials

## Extras

- Documentation
  - Add class descriptions in .py files
  - Add environment to basic-usage
- Figure out a way to make the setup generate executable examples (and connect to basic usage page)
- Suppress the pygame console text
- Test description changes on test.pypi.org
