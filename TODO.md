# TODO

## Code

- Write real tests
- Add a way to seed random number generator for repeatable trials
- Add (optional) collision detection and prevention

## Extras

- Documentation
  - Add class descriptions in .py files
- Figure out a way to make the setup generate executable examples (and connect to basic usage page)
- Suppress the pygame console text
- Test description changes on test.pypi.org
